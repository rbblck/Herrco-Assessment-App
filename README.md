<strong>Instructions</strong>

<p>
    The home page is the main app page with live updates for the spread sheet on demand.  It is initialised with a blank donut chart and the key / values are all 0.
</p>

<p>To get the number of CRUD updates, click or tap the floating update button at the bottom right part of the screen and it will compare the latest state of the spread sheet with the state it was in since the app was started or since the last click or tap of the update button.
</p>

<p>
    Any updated values will be displayed in a tickertape at the bottom of the screen, prefixed by the word “Update” followed by the product id and any changed values (the original value first and then the updated value with its corresponding title).
</p>
